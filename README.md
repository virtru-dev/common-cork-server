# common-cork-server

A common base for cork servers

## What does this do?

This common base should be used if you're building a cork server that follows
the most common pattern of cork server creation. That means you do all of the
following:

* Have a `cork` directory in your project that you intend to copy into your cork server
* Intend to use the cork
